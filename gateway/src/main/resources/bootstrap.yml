# you’ll soon see the eureka-client registered under whatever name you specify
# in the spring.application.name property. This property is used a lot in
# Spring Cloud, often in the earliest phases of a service’s configuration.
# This property is used in service bootstrap and so by convention lives
# in eureka-client/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties where it’s
# found before src/main/resources/application.properties.
